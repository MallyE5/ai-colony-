## 📜 AI Prompt Used
```
A cinematic live-action style scene of a space exploration mission, featuring 10 astronauts working alongside 5 AI-powered machines to build a new colony on an undiscovered planet. The robots and AI have intricate futuristic Romanesque Revival designs, with detailed, elegant metallic exteriors. The planet's surface is a mix of freestanding rock formations, lush rewilded ecosystems supporting biodiversity, and stunning alien landscapes. The background features breathtaking, unique planetary features such as glowing crystal formations and floating rock structures. The atmosphere conveys love, hope, and human connection, showcasing teamwork between humans and AI in this new frontier. Inspired by the cinematic styles of Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino, with dramatic lighting, high contrast, and a rich, immersive visual depth.
